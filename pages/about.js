<h1>3_ Coding Chaska's Beliefs</h1>

<p>
A person achieves maximum success when she follows her path (dharma). We must empower an individual to find her dharma. It is important for society, government, and parents to provide children with the opportunity to discover their own interests and to foster a culture of exploration and creativity among them. We need everyone’s contributions to make our country a Vishwa Guru. Everyone is capable of doing great things given a chance. Empower the masses instead of trying to solve their problems. We must believe in people. 
</p>
<p>
We need to understand the power of a free society where every individual could contribute following her dharma. Our constitution promises the liberty we need. But there are many obstacles on the way. We must fight those who want to control us. It can be a government, media, business, ideology, or religion. We must not allow anyone to control us. 
</p>
<p>
{`I don’t know who you are, I don’t know where you are. But, I know you have unique talents. You will achieve greatness because you have a unique dharma. Understanding yourself and contributing to the world around you can bring you joy.`}
</p>
<p>
We are committed to promoting self-exploration and empowerment. 
</p>
